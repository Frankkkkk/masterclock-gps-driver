# Configuration file for GPSMCR application

# A wildcard prefix identifying the system serial devices (usually ttyS)

# LogFile

# The fully-qualified filespec for application-specific log file.

# Critical operational notifications will be sent to the system log, however

#
# TimeCodeReader
#
# Applies to PCIe-TCR only.  Indicates that card is a time code reader and will
# expect a time code reference.  Lack of time code will indicate a reference loss.
#
# Possible settings:
# 0 = ignore time code functions
# 1 = IRIG time code reader
# 2 = SMPTE time code reader

TimeCodeReader=0

#
# TimeCodeHasDate
#
# Applies to PCIe-TCR only.  Indicates if date information is expected in
# time code signal.
#
# For IRIG time code, this configuration item can be set to:
# 0 - date information not available
# 1 - date information encoded to IEEE1344 specification
#
# For SMPTE time code, this configuration item can be set to:
# 0 - date information not available
# 1 - date information encoded to Leitch specification
# 2 - date information encoded to 309M standard, with time zone
# 3 - date information encoded to 309M standard, no time zone
#
# When date is not encoded in time code signal, the PCIe-TCR will rely on
# date information stored in the card's internal RTC.  (Date will need to
# be set correctly on first use.) 
#
# Time code date settings are ignored by PCIe-GPS and PCIe-OSC cards.
#

TimeCodeHasDate=0

# ProcessFile
#
# The fully-qualified filespec for process instance file
#
# A lock on this file prevents multiple instances of GPSMCR from being started.

# The fully-qualifed filespec for GPSMCR's inter-process socket.

#
# JamThreshold
#
# Amount of system/reference time discrepency (in seconds) allowed before a "jam sync" to time 
# reference is performed.  Note that jam syncs can sometimes cause disruptions for automation
# systems and other time-sensitive application.
#
# Set to 0 to disable jam synchronization.

JamThreshold=30

#
# TickThreshold
#
# Amount of system/reference time discrepency (in seconds) allowed before adjustment will be
# applied to the system clock tick frequency.  These adjustments provide for faster frequency
# corrections of larger time discrepencies.
#
# Set to 0 to disable clock tick adjustment.

TickThreshold=4

#
# TickAdjustment
#
# For system clock tick adjustments, the amount of adjustment (in ticks / second) to apply
# per second.  Can not exceed 1000.

TickAdjustment=1000

#
# FrequencyAdjustment
#
# For system clock frequency adjustments, the maximum amount of adjustment (in microseconds) to apply

FrequencyAdjustment=500

#
# FrequencyThreshold

# Amount of system/reference time discrepency (in microseconds) allowed before adjustment will be

# be adjusted to finer precision by the frequency maintenance algorithm.
